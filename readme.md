This is the Software Development Club Website. 
You do not need to continue reading if you are not an editor. 

###Editors, You **MUST** Read On

The Current Pages Are:

* index.html
* portfolio.html
* memb.html
* contact.html

If you wish to make a bug fix, edit the original files. 
If you wish to make a major remodel or redesign, duplicate the html file and insert a "-new" to the end of the file name. After you finish, get approval from the Admins and show the redesign to Daiki. He will finalise the redesign. 

Example:
contact.html ---> contact-new.html

Old files are stored in the "archived" directory of the website.
